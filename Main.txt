= What is GwtGL? =

GwtGL provides a basic GWT widget and [BindingOverview binding] for the upcoming WebGL standard (maintained by the WebGL working group at Khronos Group).

GwtGL enables you to develop 3D websites and web applications using the Java programming language instead of !JavaScript.
Type safety and the Java Toolset help you to write your apps in less time compared to plain !JavaScript development.
The GWT compiler generates optimized !JavaScript code, so you will achieve higher frame rates.

= What is WebGL? =

WebGL is a graphics API based on OpenGL ES 2.0. 
It enables developers to create hardware accelerated 3D graphics which can be embedded into HTML websites.
All mayor browsers will support WebGL in the near future, 
so there is no need for a plugin to be able to view WebGL enriched sites.

= Demos =

[http://gwtgl-examples.appspot.com/ Click here] to see a live version of our demos. You need a [BrowserSupport WebGL enabled browser] to see the examples.
*Online demos are outdated. A new version will be uploaded soon.*

= Using GwtGL in your GWT project =

Include GwtGL into your classpath.
Add the following line to your *.gwt.xml to have access to the WebGL [BindingOverview binding]:
{{{
<inherits name='com.googlecode.gwtgl.binding'/>
}}}

= Getting started =

The easiest way to start learning GwtGL is to read the [Documentation] in our wiki.
Don't forget to install a [BrowserSupport WebGL compatible browser].
